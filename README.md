# Development Environment

I used tutorials and cocumentation to figure out how to make the code.

I used the Xcode interface and the swift programing lenguage. I didn't used any aditional libraries to make the program work.

# Future Work

* The program crashes when I try to do more than one operation at the time. For example, I can do 2+2=4-2=2, but not 2+2-2=2.
* I need to add decimals.
* I need to add the option to convert from kilometers to miles and other similar features, which was the original idea, but I got cought following the calculator tutorial for too long.
